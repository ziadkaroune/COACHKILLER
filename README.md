![CoachKiller](./images/coachkiller.png)
## Project Overview

**CoachKiller** is a no-fluff, anti-toxic positivity AI app that hilariously reframes your most dramatic inner thoughts using LLM-powered coaching sass. Think of it as your brutally honest, slightly sarcastic, and secretly insightful mental coach â€” without the $997 webinar.

Built with React, Tailwind CSS, and a backend powered by OpenRouter's LLM API, CoachKiller breaks your thought spiral into five fun-sized roast sessions â€” each with a punchy title, a sharp perspective shift, and a mic-drop ending.
